Updated Info;
- Fixed issues related to gift code usage.
- Resolved the issue where gift code usage caused excessive waiting during TIMEOUT situations; the process is now faster.
- Fixed the issue where the notification system kept displaying a "Channel not found" error in the console when a channel was deleted.
- Fixed the issue where an invalid user addition continuously caused errors in the console.
- The automatic gift code usage actually works, but you need to enable the Automatic Gift Settings in the configuration.
- Added a feature to the Automatic Gift Settings Menu that allows activating all alliances at once.
- Now, when a new alliance is created, the Automatic Gift Code Usage setting will be enabled by default.
- Enabled mass gift code usage for all alliances (the "All Alliances" option is now available when selecting an alliance).
- Previously, when selecting a gift code channel, it checked messages every 5 minutes; now, it checks instantly.
- When using gift codes excessively, the bot forgot to tell Discord "I'm working here," causing it to restart during the process. This issue has been fixed.
- Removed unnecessary details from the console during gift code usage. Now, nothing will be written in the console, but gift_log.txt will keep more detailed records.
- Added an embed message type for the notification system. Now, you can set notifications as embeds and place the timestamp wherever you like. Details are available on Discord and in the usage guide.
- I'm still working on new additions and bug fixes, so I've shared them in advance so you don't have to wait too long

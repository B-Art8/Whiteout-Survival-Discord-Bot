Updated Info;
- You can now turn off the notification message sent during an automatic check
- Added whether or not the auto-check notification message is turned on to the message the bot sends when it starts
- Fixed error for main.py asking for update 2 times on first install
- Fixed SSL error when adding members on some servers (I didn't have any problems so I couldn't test it)
- New gift code check has been added. Now that some gift codes are tied to a redemption limit, it will notify you when the redemption limit is reached
